## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
 1. Waze
    1. I like how I am able to get a notification when there is a accident or traffic
    2.How quickly the app is able to change my route if I take a wrong turn
 2. Youtube
    1. You can keep track of the videos that you liked.
    2. You make playlist for videos.
 3. Photos app
    1. The memories of pictures taken from a decade ago.
    2. The categories for types of pictures 
4. Tiktok
    1.The stem feature which is a STEM oriented for-you page
    2. The inbox which lets me know all of my activities.
    
    I want to create a bus app for my school or better it. Rutgers has a bus system that is made extremely complicated by the apps such as Passio-go. It doesn't exactly track the busses and the timings are wrong several times. I plan to improve on it by making the bus routes real-time so students are able to know exactly when the busses are going to arrive and a feature where bus drivers can notify when they get on break and how crowded the buses are. It will some features from waze where bus drivers are notified when there is traffic and can update on the app, the status of the bus.
    
## Notes
    It was hard to figure out how the application worked and where all of the necessary materials like the files were then I was able to learn how to navigate xcode.
